- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
  
### What I learned

- More on CSS Grid.
- Centering a div.

### Continued development

- Indepth knowledge on CSS Grid and Flexbox, because without them, it is almost impossible to create a well laid out web page.

## Acknowledgments

I must say that I am proud of myself. I had doubts of not been able to pull off this challenge. Of a truth, not trying at something is far worse than failing at that thing. I am excitedly looking forward to continuous growth as I try out more challenges, even intricate ones.
